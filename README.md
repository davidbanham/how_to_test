# How To Test

This repo contains the test materials for a testing workshop developed by [David Banham](https://davidbanham.com) of [Notbad Software](https://notbad.software). It's intended as a pragmatic introduction to the whys and hows of testing. It's aimed at people who know how to write code, but don't have much experience in writing automated tests for it.

The examples are done in NodeJS but the principles are generally applicable. The focus is on concepts and techniques rather than tools and libraries.

The presentation slides are in /slides and the examples are in /examples.

Have fun!
